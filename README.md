# sunshade [WIP]
## Introduction
The sunshade project is a program for the [arduino](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino_(Plattform)) computing-platform.
The main purpose of this program is to open and close our big sunshade.
## System Desciption
### Motor and Transmission
The the required mechanical work to open and close the sunshade comes from a dc motor.
This dc motor is directly conected to a transmission.
Both devices are recycled from an old cordless screwdrive.
### Motor Driver
The h-bridge module xxx drives the motor.
### Interface
For the controll interface the IR modul zzz is set up.
I still have a small doubt if it is working while the sunshade is closed, 
but I will figured it out later.
### Single-board microcontroller
Like mention befor a arduino computing-platform is used for the program processing and I/O controlling job.
Currently the Mega2560 is in charge. But for later on it could be change to a Nano variant.
## POC
To finde out if the approach, to recycle the devices of an old cordless screwdrive for I executed a simple POC :-).
